# Space Invaders

## Introduction
- This is a variation of a project in my AP Computer Science Class
- Inspiration taken from the retro *Space Invaders* game
- Any instructions in `here` means that the commands should be typed in a terminal or command line

## Cheat Codes
- `baller` (unlimited bullets and super speed) *high score is not counted if you use `baller`*
- `stop` (stops the cheat mode)
- `life` (adds an extra life)

## Commands
- `game` (restarts game)
- `hard` (aliens are harder but you get extra points)
- `norm` (goes back to normal aliens, less points) 
- `og` (slower cooldown but more points!)
- `new` (goes back to normal cooldown, less points)

## How to play:
- `git clone https://github.com/asboyer2/SpaceInvaders/tree/master/code`
### Two ways:
- double click on the `game.jar`
-```java -jar game.jar```

## How to contribute
- fork the repo
- `cd SpaceInvaders\code`
- edit `SI_panel.java`
- submit a pull request

### What to do:
- Add player name
- Keep track of high scores on file
- Images for player and aliens

*any help would be appreciated!*
